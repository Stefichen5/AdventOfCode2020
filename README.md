# Advent of code 2020

My work for advent of code 2020. At least as far as I feel motivated.

I will try to solve the tasks in Bash. Depending on my free time and motivation, I will also add solutions in other programming/scripting languages.

Everything uploaded has worked for me, giving me the right answers. No guarantee that it will work for you too.

Have a nice advent of code. Please don't use my code to cheat.
